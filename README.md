# SIENA

## Scope
SIENA is a tool to analyse the morphology of the extended emission line region morphology in 3D spectroscopic observations of AGN. It performs a multi-gaussian fit of the AGN spectrum and traces the
individual components across the field of view by keeping the kinematic parameters fixed to the ones retrieved
from the central spaxel. Furthermore, the PSF can be used to distinguish between point-like vs. resolved emission
and to locate the centroid. SIENA is developed based on observations of unobscured (type 1) AGN taken with
ESO VLT/MUSE. The technique is applicable to 3D cubes obtained with other IFU instruments.
