# SIENA

## Scope
SIENA is a tool to analyse the morphology of the extended emission line region morphology in 3D spectroscopic observations of AGN.
It performs a multi-Gaussian fit of the AGN emission line spectrum and traces different kinematic components across the field of view by keeping the kinematic parameters tied. Furthermore, SIENA utilizes the emprical PSF extracted from the data to measure the projected size, location and luminosity of the emitting structure. SIENA is developed based on observations of unobscured (type 1) AGN that were aquired with
ESO VLT/MUSE. The technique can in principle be to 3D cubes obtained with other IFU instruments.
